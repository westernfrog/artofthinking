            I have taken up Life Transforming Workshops to offer a supportive
            community where teenagers and young adults can attend workshops on
            various aspects of mental health, such as stress, anxiety, body
            shaming, peer pressure, relationship issues, workload, bullying,
            anger management, handling failures, setting smart goals, resolving
            conflicts, and navigating dilemmas. By participating in these
            workshops, they experienced personal growth, increased
            self-empowerment, self-confidence, and self- management.
